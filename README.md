A Brief Introduction
=====================

The BÉPO layout for my keyboard since 2010-ish, and it’s been one of the best computing
decisions I’ve ever taken. The BÉPO layout is an optimized layout for French, but it works quite well
for many European languages, English included (the only issue you might have with the BÉPO layout
for English is that the w is a bit far away).

To come up with the BÉPO layout, ideas from a man named August Dvorak were applied for the French
language. Today, the keyboard layout that is optimised for English is called after him, the DVORAK
layout. Dvorak’s ideas were quite simple; unlike the QWERTY layout, his layout had to be based on
character frequency of the English language. The main idea is that the most used
characters of the language should be on the home row of the keyboard. The home row is the row where
you lay your fingers on the keyboard when you are not typing (see picture below).

The problem with the “standard” layouts, such as QWERTY, is that they’re all absolute garbage, and
not optimized at all for typing on a computer. For instance, look at the heatmap below, which shows
the most used characters on a QWERTY keyboard when typing an a standard English text:

(Heatmap generated on https://www.patrick-wied.at/projects/heatmap-keyboard/.)

As you can see, most of the characters used to type this text are actually outside of the home row, and
the majority of them on the left hand side of the keyboard. The idea of Dvorak was to first, put the
most used characters on the home row, and second to try to have an equal split of characters, 50% for each hand.

The same text on the DVORAK layout, shows how superior it is:

As you can see, this is much much better. The same idea was applied to develop the BÉPO layout for
French. And because character frequency is quite similar across languages, learning a layout such as
the BÉPO not only translates to more efficient typing for French, but also for other languages, such
as English, as already explained above.

The reason I’m writing this blog post is due, in part, to the confinement situation
that many people on Earth are currently facing due to the Corona virus. I have a job where I spend
my whole day typing, and am lucky enough to be able to work from home. Which means that I’m lucky
enough to use my mechanical keyboard to work, which is really great. (I avoid taking my mechanical
keyboard with me at work, because I am never very long in the same spot, between meeting and client
assignments…). But to have a mechanical keyboard that’s easy to take with me,
I decided to buy a second mechanical keyboard, a 40% keyboard from Ergodox (see picture below):

Because I don’t even want to see the QWERTY keycaps, I bought blank keycaps to replace the ones that
come with the keyboard. Anyway, this made me think about how crazy it is that in 2020 people still
use absolute garbage keyboard layouts (and keyboards by the way) to type on, when their job is
basically only typing all day long. It made me so angry that I even made a video, which you enjoy
here.

The other thing I thought about was the specific case of Luxembourg, a country with 3 official
languages (Luxembourguish, French and German), a very large Portuguese minority, and where English
became so important in recent years that the government distributed leaflets in English to the
population (along with leaflets in French, Luxembourguish, German and Portuguese of course) explaining
what is and is not allowed during the period of containment. What would a keyboard optimized for
such a unique country look like?

Of course, the answer that comes to mind quickly is to use the BÉPO layout; even though people routinely
write in at least 3 of the above-mentioned languages, French is still the one that people use most
of the time for written communication (at least, that’s my perception). The reason is that while
Luxembourguish is the national language, and the language of the native population, French has
always been the administrative language, and laws are still written in French only, even though
they’re debated in Luxembourguish in the parliament.
However, people also routinely write emails in German or English, and more and more people also
write in Luxembourguish. This means that a keyboard optimized for Luxembourguish, or rather, for
the multilinguistic nature of the Luxembourguish country, should take into account all these
different languages. Another thing to keep in mind is that Luxembourguish uses many French words,
and as such, writing these words should be easy.

So let’s start with the BÉPO layout as a base. This is what it looks like:

A heatmap of character frequencies of a French, or even English, text would show that the most used
characters are on the home row. If you compare DVORAK to BÉPO, you will see that the home row is
fairly similar. But what strikes my colleagues when they see a picture of the BÉPO layout, is the
fact that the characters é, è, ê, à and ç can be accessed directly. They are so used to having
these characters only accessible by using some kind of modifier key that their first reaction is to
think that this is completely stupid. However, what is stupid, is not having these letters easily
accessible, and instead having, say, z easily accessible (the French “standard” layout is called
AZERTY, which is very similar and just as stupid as the QWERTY layout. The letter Z is so easy to
type on, but is almost non-existing in French!).
